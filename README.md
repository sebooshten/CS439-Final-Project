The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrieltardochi/counter-strike-global-offensive-matches?select=csgo_games.csv

Best way to run this on your own is download the project zip and simply run the main.ipynb

If you will be downloading the Jupyter Notebook file to run the code yourself instead of just downloading this project as a zip, just ensure that the "csgo_games" CSV is in the same folder directory as the main.ipynb

Here is a video going through the code for this project:

(This is the demo of the project before it was requested to be in Jupyter notebook, it still contains the exact same code)
