The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrieltardochi/counter-strike-global-offensive-matches?select=csgo_games.csv

If you will be downloading the Jupyter Notebook to run the code yourself instead of just downloading this repository as a zip, keep in mind that it is reading a CSV from a folder named "CS439_FinalProject".
So, you can either create a folder with this name to place the CSV and Jupyter Notebook file in, or change the name in read_csv('CS439_FinalProject/csgo_games.csv'), to match
your own preference. The same applies to the creation of the updated CSV which expects to write a CSV to the same location, to_csv('CS439_FinalProject/csgo_games_analysis.csv', index=False)

Here is a video going through the code for this project:

(This is the demo of the project before it was requested to be in Jupyter notebook, it still contains the exact same code)
